  Chanting this hymn regularly unlocks blessings on **three planes**—**physical, mental, and spiritual**. Here’s how:


  ###  **1. Physical Vitality**


  The verse *“Āyurvardhana Uttamam”* praises the Sun as the giver of longevity. Chanting at sunrise energizes the body, strengthens the immune system, and enhances overall health.


  ###  **2. Mental Clarity**


  *“Cintā-śoka Praśamanam”* points to the stotram’s power to **relieve anxiety, grief, and doubt**. Its vibrations stabilize the mind and uplift the emotions.


  ###  **3. Spiritual Direction**


  *“Dhyeyaḥ Sadā Savitṛ Maṇḍala Madhyavartī”* encourages meditation on the **solar orb**—awakening inner vision and guiding one through life’s trials.


  ###  **4. Triumph Over Obstacles**


  As it empowered Rama to defeat Ravana, the hymn helps devotees conquer **personal demons**, be they fear, inertia, ego, or adversity.


  ###  **5. Karmic Cleansing**


  Chanting regularly burns away negative karma, aligns one with **dharma (righteous action)**, and cultivates spiritual purity—just as sunlight dispels the morning mist.


  ### **B﻿est time**


  Chant at **sunrise**, facing east, when Surya’s energy is strongest.
