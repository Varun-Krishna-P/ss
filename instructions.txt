Step-by-Step Fix
1. Ensure local_backend: true is set correctly
In your config.yml, it should be at the top level:
local_backend: true

backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main


This tells Netlify CMS to use the local proxy server instead of GitHub directly.

2. Start the local proxy server
You must run the Netlify CMS proxy server locally for local_backend to work:
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server


This starts a local server at http://localhost:8081 that Netlify CMS will use to read/write files.

3. Ensure your site is served locally
Run your dev server (e.g., Gatsby):
npm run develop


Then visit:
http://localhost:8000/admin


Netlify CMS will now use the proxy server instead of GitHub.

4. Check your browser console
If you still see GitHub API calls, it means:
- local_backend: true is not being picked up
- Or the proxy server isn’t running
Make sure both are active and that your config.yml is being loaded correctly.
